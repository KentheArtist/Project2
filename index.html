        <h1>My Long, Strange Journey Since Last November</h1>
           <p>I was born at the old Provident Hospital and raised in the house where I still live on the south side of Chicago. I've been passing by <a href="https://flic.kr/p/f88qrW" title="IIT Fountain" target="_blank">that iconic IIT fountain</a> at 33rd and State since I was a child in the 1960's. But never in my life did I ever think I would be sitting in a classroom at Illinois Institute of Technology. Illinois Tech. IIT. Whatever they're calling it now.</p>
           <p>I've been drawing since I could hold a crayon, so being a working graphic designer and illustrator was a foregone conclusion for me. And for most of my working career, that's exactly what I've been, either on-staff or freelance. Not to mention a <a href="https://flic.kr/ps/pgr2S" title="My Flickr Photostream" target="_blank">photographer</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/artistmac" title="My YouTube Channel" target="_blank">videographer</a>.</p>

        <h3>THE ACCIDENT</h3>
           <p>The morning of Tuesday, November 7, 2017, I was comfortable as a State Representative's assistant. Not necessarily happy, considering that I had taken the job almost nine years earlier when the Great Recession hit and the <a href="http://www.kensmithillustration.com" title="Ken Smith's Business Website" target="_blank">freelance illustration</a> business took a serious nosedive, but I was keeping my bills paid. I was delivering event fliers for my job that fateful day. I had just left West Englewood library on my mountain bike, headed for Ogden Park, and that's the last thing I remember for the next five days after <a href="bikeaccident.html" title="Timeline of the Accident" target="_blank">THE ACCIDENT</a>, when I finally regained consciousness in the ICU at Stroger Hospital. Ouch. I don't even remember it happening! In the ICU, I did have the presence of mind to take a selfie with my nearly out-of-juice Blackberry, which survived the impact in perfect condition, in spite of being in my pocket on the side where the truck hit me.</p>
           <p>The police report, which Chicago's finest had helpfully tucked in my wallet while I was knocked out on the ground being treated by the EMT's, said that I had gone through a red light while riding on Ashland at 65th. Of course, the only one the police were able to talk to so they could write the report was the driver that hit me. Having whacked my head on the pavement and out cold (I have two hematomas as mementos), I was in no condition to tell my side of the story. Namely, that I had been riding a bicycle for my job for the previous five years, and after a few harrowing experiences of dodging opening car doors and nearly having my left elbow removed by drivers veering into the bike lane, I would never in my life ride any distance on a busy arterial street like Ashland, Halsted or Western.</p>

        <h3>The Road Back</h3>
           <p>The irony is, the reason I recovered so quickly from a bicycle accident that very nearly killed me was because I was so fit from riding -- drum roll -- <a href="https://flic.kr/p/cqDH5w" title="Schwinn High Plains on Flickr" target="_blank">the bicycle!</a> Long story short, I was ready to go back to work a month and a half after the accident. My boss, as they say, chose to go in another direction, and, except for freelance jobs, I have not worked since. I had to dust off a <a href="kensmithsresume.html" title="Ken Smith's Resume" target="_blank"> resume</a> that I had basically been keeping updated like a newspaper obituary file since 1992, never dreaming that I would ever need it again.</p>
        <h3>Illinois Institute of Technology!? Yes.</h3>
           <p>All hail the Illinois Department of Employment Security. For us oldsters whose skills may be a bit behind the times (I had learned HTML back in 2000, when Plymouths and Oldsmobiles roamed the earth), the unemployment office pays for retraining. </p>
           <p>So, here I am, having not set foot in a college classroom as a student for 25 years. And the first course I took here this summer after that extended hiatus was -- Java. JAAAAVVVAAAA!! And a major component of Java is algebra, which I had not boxed with since high school, when algebra was Emile Griffith and I was Benny Paret. But, having survived that bike accident, Java wasn't going to bring me down. And it didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X6sC8G3jiMg" title="hyperlink to YouTube video" target="_blank">Bring on HTML5!</a> </p>
